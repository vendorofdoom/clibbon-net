[Cuttlefish](https://vendorofdoom.itch.io/cuttlefish) simulates two little cuttlefish in their tank.

You can interact with the cuttlefish and observe their AI behaviour, such as how their colour and pattern changes in response to their enviroment and how they respond to food or being poked.

This was an individual coursework piece created in Unity. The game assets were created by me using Unity primitives and Maya (cuttlefish, castle, seaweed).
